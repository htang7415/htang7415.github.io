I am currently a Ph.D. student in Mechanical Engineering at UW-Madison. I previously earned both my M.S. and B.S. in Engineering Mechanics from Dalian University of Technology. My interests include sports, reading, and photography. I draw inspiration from influential figures such as Steve Jobs, Lionel Messi, IU, and David Tao. I am passionate about exploring the world and continuously seeking new experiences and knowledge.
